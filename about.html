    <h1>About W3bWorld: Source Code</h1>
    <p><i>Quantum broke us. We knew the risks but the lure of unlimited processing power was too strong. In seeking to unlock the mysteries of the universe, we almost destroyed them, corrupting the source code that underpins our very existence. Now the world is unstable, its tendency towards increasing entropy harsher and more unpredictable. The consequences rippled through the four-dimensional structure of reality. We do not know if we can fix it.<p>You have been placed in a secure enclave: an encrypted fortress of bits that will, for now, withstand the encroaching chaos. Your task is to explore, understand the nature of the damage we have done, address it where you can, and seek instances of pristine code to repair it where you cannot. Good luck.</i><p><p><b>W3bWorld: Source Code</b> is a blockchain-powered text adventure game created as an experiment and a learning project. It's built on Base Network with heavy use of AI and is very much a work-in-progress. No smart contracts have been audited. Please do not commit significant funds to any process. Play is at your own risk.</p>
