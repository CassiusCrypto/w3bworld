W3bWorld is a blockchain-powered text adventure game
The interface is classic text adventure style, with a field for inputs and a panel with outputs on the left.
To the right will be a space for images, which can be ASCII text art.
The user connects with MetaMask. Key objects and milestones are represented by NFTs. The game infers state from these.
The inventory is drawn directly from the blockchain. We may have a separate inventory for minor items.
Different areas of the map are open to the player depending on what items they hold in their wallet.
Users can navigate around, look at their location, take objects, examine items, use them, and so on.
The map is held in a separate file that contains all the information for the game.
The map will include fields that specify what items need to be held for a location to be accessible.
There will be locations where you can interact with other services, based on smart contracts (for example, playing a game).
Some commands will only work in certain locations, or when you own certain items
Some rooms will have state affected by your inventory (e.g. only lit if you have a torch)

The structure needs to be modular:
- Map (navigation and "look"); visibility of locations depends on inventory (NFTs)
- Objects inc NPCs (takeable, mintable, useable)
- Actions (requires object, dependent on location can be dependent on immovable object)

E.g. When in The Bank you can Mint and Redeem Khoyns, but nowhere else.
In order to access The Cave, you need the Level2 NFT
To Unlock the Door in The Cave, you need The Key 

Commands: Movement, observation, interaction, inventory, communication, game state, custom/one-off
