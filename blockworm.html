    <h1>About Blockworm: Web3 Content and Communications</h1>
    <p>There's a saying that a picture is worth a thousand words, but this undersells the significance of written text.
    <p>Words and images are not treated alike by the brain. While pictures are closer to the way the brain encodes sensory experiences, words act as powerful retrieval cues because they are abstract, tapping into the brainâ€™s highly interconnected semantic networks and linking to many related ideas. The brain relies on language to categorize and label information and experiences, organizing them into narratives that are inherently verbal in nature. 
    <p>In a world of abstract concepts such as the Web3 space, images aren't noise - but words can be pure signal.
    <p>Blockworm has partnered with Web3 projects for content and communications since 2014, including Maker Foundation, COTI, KlimaDAO, Scrow.Network, and many others.
